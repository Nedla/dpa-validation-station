# DPA Validation Station
## Carleton University Foruth Year Project
Software suite to used in conjunction with a validation station to validate the security of hardware implementation.

### Supervisor
Mostafa Taha, Carleton University

### Members
- Alden Wang, Software Engineering
- John Turner
- Aaron Vuong

### Build Status

### Project Proposal
Create a fully equipped and deployable workstation complete with a software suite for hardware implementation verification. This station will be able to capture leaked information (side-channels) from a device or board during a cryptographic algorithm execution, and can be used to analyse the implementation. This station should be able to verify and evaluate the side-channel security of the implemented hardware.

### Features
- Perform statistical analysis on given trace data

### Project Status 10-29-2019
- Project created

### TODO
- Proof of concept
