TODO
    8 bits of key xor 8 bits of plaintext
    using exhaustive combinations of plaintext 8 bits long,
    encrypt it on the board, 
    capture the power trace / time

    then, ASSUME the key, 8 bits (exhaustive)
    using the same plaintext, generate a model that
    
    somehow? build a model representing the power consumed during each round,
    compare it to the traces captured

    apply welches t-test to determine if the sets are DISTINGUISHABLE
